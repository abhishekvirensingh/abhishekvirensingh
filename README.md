## 🧑‍💻 About Me

A data engineer who loves to tackle technology-related challenges and strives to solve them in the best possible way.

Before transitioning to the role of data engineer, I worked extensively in application integration and web services development. With more than 10 years of experience working for various MNCs, I bring a strong background in building scalable solutions.

My strengths lie in Spark, Python, SQL, and the creation of robust data pipelines. As a data engineer, I've had the privilege to collaborate with talented senior developers, software architects, and data scientists from NielsenIQ and the Mercedes F1 team.
