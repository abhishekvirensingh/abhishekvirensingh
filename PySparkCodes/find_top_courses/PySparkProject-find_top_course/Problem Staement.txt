Finding Out Popular Courses for a Online Training Company
=========================================================

Problem Statement:
-----------------

We have been approached by an Online Training Company which
provides training videos.The company provides different online
courses to the users and each course comprises of multiple
chapters.Courses have been assigned courseIds and Chapters in a
course have chapterIDs.Note that chapterlds are unique.No two
courses can have same chapterId.Each Course has a title also.
Also, Users viewing the courses are given UserlIds.

The company wants us to prepare an Apache Spark based report
which will enable them to figure out which are the most popular
courses on their training portal.

The popularity of a course will depend on the total score it
receives.The score which a course will get will be based on few
business rules which are explained later in the document in
detail.Please Refer the Business Rules** Section.To give a brief
overview, consider if a course has 20 chapters and a user views 18
chapters out of those, then the user has watched 90% of the course
and the course will get a good score of 10 say.Like that each
course can be watched by multiple users and scores will
accumulate for that course.

Final Ranking Chart Report will look like below, Starting with
most popular course on the top.

Score Title
x1 Y1
X2 Y2

Dataset Details:

Datasetl 1

We have a csv file views.csv,

userId, chapterId, dateAndTime
This will be a log of viewings, showing which user has viewed which
chapter. These chapterIds belong to courses. Also chapterIds are
unique.

Here is the sample raw data:

userId chapterId
14 96
14 97
15 96
13 96
14 99
3 100

Dataset 2: | So we have a much smaller dataset, chapters.csv which is a
mapping of chapterlds to courseld.

Sample Raw Data:

chapterlId courseld
96 1
97 1
98 1
99 2

Dataset 3:

There is another dump file (titles.csv) containing courselds against their

Expected Output of Sample Raw Data:

2 1

produce a ranking chart detailing based on which are the most popular courses by score.

** Business Rules:

Scores which each courseld gets, will be based on few rules:
Like ,If a user sticks through most of the course, that's more
deserving of "points" than if someone bails out just a quarter
way through the course. Following is the scoring system

algorithm followed:

if a user watches more than 90% of the course, the course

gets 10 points

if a user watches > 50% but <90% , it scores 4
if a user watches > 25% but < 50% it scores 2
Less than 25% is no score
